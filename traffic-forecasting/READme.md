## Traffic forecasting using graph neural networks and LSTM
This example uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the future values of the traffic speed given a history of the traffic speed for a collection of road segments.

The example is inspired by this paper: [Yu, Bing, Haoteng Yin, and Zhanxing Zhu. "Spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks: a deep learning framework for traffic forecasting."](https://github.com/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18).
